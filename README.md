# Air Qualiy Monitor Project 

## What the project does

### Create an indoor air quality monitor station with [tinkerforge.com](https://tinkerforge.com/en/doc/) bricklets and a raspberry pi zero.

The station uses an [Integrated Air Quality (IAQ) sensor](https://www.tinkerforge.com/en/doc/Hardware/Bricklets/Air_Quality.html#air-quality-bricklet) and a [CO2 sensor](https://www.tinkerforge.com/en/doc/Hardware/Bricklets/CO2_V2.html) to monitor air quality inside the room. An [alert sound](https://www.tinkerforge.com/en/doc/Hardware/Bricklets/Piezo_Speaker_V2.html#piezo-speaker-v2-bricklet) is generated, when both sensors detect bad air quality. The alert level can be adjusted via setup. The porject is based on the modification of the [Tabletop Weather Station](https://www.tinkerforge.com/en/doc/Kits/TabletopWeatherStation/TabletopWeatherStation.html).

A graph is plotted for both sensor outputs (IAQ and CO2):
